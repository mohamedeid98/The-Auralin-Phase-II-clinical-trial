# This-Auralin-Phase-II-clinical-trial
Phase II clinical trial data that compares the efficacy and safety of a new oral insulin to treat diabetes to injectable insulin

### This Data Isn't "Real"

The Auralin and Novodra are not real insulin products. This clinical trial data was fabricated for the sake of this course. When assessing this data, the issues that you'll detect (and later clean) are meant to simulate real-world data quality and tidiness issues.

That said:

- This dataset was constructed with the consult of real doctors to ensure plausibility.
- This clinical trial data for an alternative insulin was inspired and closely mimics this real clinical trial for an inhaled insulin called Afrezza(opens in a new tab).
- The data quality issues in this dataset mimic real, common data quality issues in healthcare data(opens in a new tab). These issues impact quality of care, patient registration, and revenue.
- The patients in this dataset were created using this fake name generator(opens in a new tab) and do not include real names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, etc.
